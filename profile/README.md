# GCSE/A-level Coding Challenges Booklet Organisation
This organisation is a collection of solutions to the [OCR GCSE/A-level Computer Science Coding Challenges Booklet](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf).
Each coding challenge in the booklet has it's own repoistory within this organisation. Each repository will include a README explaining the code challenge and the solution. Repositories may have multiple solutions stored in folders by the language used.

## Code Challenges
If you would like to search through the code challenges, I would recommend clicking on the [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories) button next to "Overview" in the top row of button and using the search bar there. You can search using the name of the challenge, the difficulty [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy), [Medium](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=medium), [Hard](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=hard), the language such as [Python](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=python), [Rust](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=rust), [C](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=c), [Java](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=java), or by searching for a key word to do with the challenge such as [Recursion](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=recursion) or [Game](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=game).
| Challenge | Repository | Languages  | Difficulty | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Factorial Finder | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder/tree/main/Python), [Rust](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder/tree/main/Rust) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion. |
| Speed Tracker | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/SpeedTracker) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/SpeedTracker/tree/main/Python) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | Create a program that takes a time for a car going past a speed camera, the time going past the next one and the distance between them to calculate the average speed for the car in mph. The cameras are one mile apart. | 
| Thief | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Thief) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Thief/tree/main/Python) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the user. The program should avoid displaying the same combination more than once. |
| Classification | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Classification) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Classification/tree/main/Python) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | A simple classification system asks a series of Yes/No questions in order to work out what type of animal is being looked at. |
| Fruit Machine | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FruitMachine) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FruitMachine/tree/main/Python) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | Write a program to simulate a Fruit Machine that displays three symbols at random from Cherry :cherries:, Bell :bell:, Lemon :lemon:, Orange :orange:, Star :star:, Skull :skull:. |
| Unit Converter | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/UnitConverter) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/UnitConverter/tree/main/Python) | [Easy](https://github.com/orgs/CodingChallengesBooklet/repositories?q=easy) | Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion . |
