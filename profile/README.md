# GCSE/A-level Coding Challenges Booklet Organisation
This organisation is a collection of solutions to the OCR GCSE/A-level Computer Science Coding Challenges Booklet ([link](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf)).
Each coding challenge in the booklet has it's own repoistory within this organisation. Each repository will include a README explaining the code challenge and the solution. Repositories may have multiple solutions stored in folders by the language used.

## Code Challenges
| Challenge | Repository | Languages  | Difficulty | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Factorial Finder | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder/tree/main/Python), [Rust](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/FactorialFinder/tree/main/Rust) | Easy | The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion. |
| Speed Tracker | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/SpeedTracker) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/SpeedTracker/tree/main/Python) | Easy | Create a program that takes a time for a car going past a speed camera, the time going past the next one and the distance between them to calculate the average speed for the car in mph. The cameras are one mile apart. | 
| Thief | [Click Here](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Thief) | [Python](https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet/Thief/tree/main/Python) | Easy | Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the user. The program should avoid displaying the same combination more than once. |
